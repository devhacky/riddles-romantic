    <h2>My Love,</h2>
    <p>Happy Birthday, my favorite human.</p>
    <p>On this day, the world got lucky—because you were born. And I got luckier—because somehow, the universe crossed our paths and gave me you.</p>
    <p>There’s so much I love about you, it’s hard to know where to start. I love your smile—the way it makes everything feel lighter. I love the way you laugh, unfiltered and real, like the world disappears for a second and it’s just us. I love how you care, how deeply you feel, and how beautifully you love.</p>
    <p>You’ve brought so much joy into my life. You’ve been my calm during storms, my partner in chaos, and my reason to believe in magic.</p>
    <p>Every memory with you is a treasure. Every moment, no matter how small—whether it’s a late-night call, a goofy conversation, or a quiet walk—is something I hold close.</p>
    <p>Today, I want you to feel how loved you are—not just by me, but by the entire universe that somehow conspired to bring you here and now, just as you are.</p>
    <p>You deserve the world and more. I hope this birthday gives you even a small piece of that, starting with this little surprise.</p>
    <p>There’s so much more to come. But for now, just know this:<br><strong>I love you. Madly, deeply, endlessly.</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Always yours,<br><strong>Praju</strong></p>
